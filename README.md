# Milestone1-GLM

This is my first milestone project of the Full Stack web developer course. 

It is a website for a small car and motorbike repairs and motor trader business.

## UX

 The purpose of this project is to make the business and its services more attractive to a wider
audience, create a positive first impression and enhance the brand. It will also help
generate more business and increase sales.

The target audience is private individuals looking for a reliable local garage for repairs, advice or used cars and motorbikes.

* User 1 has a specific issue with their car and they check if this garage is potentially able to fix it by reading about the services offered on the homepage.

* User 2 is looking for used cars or motorbike from a trustworthy local source, and
comes across this website where he can find photos and basic information about the available models, and send a
query through the website by filling in the contact form.

* User 3 is in an emergency and needs their car fixed by Monday to be able to go to
work. He is looking for a mechanic who’s working flexible hours, even weekends.
Looking at the contact page he can check the opening hours and quickly contact the
business by calling the telephone number in the header.

Users see similar layout and colour scheme on all 3 pages. It features the same background image on all 3 pages with a white header on top and black footer on the bottom.  

The website is responsive, on medium and small viewports the telephone number is hidden from the header and on small wiewports the menu items are stacked below the company logo. The content also shrinks to  fit the current viewport width.
