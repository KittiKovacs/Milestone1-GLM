# Milestone1-GLM

This is my first milestone project in the Full Stack web developer course. 

It is a website for a small car and motorbike repairs and motor trader business.

## UX

 The purpose of this project is to make the business and its services more available to a wider
audience, create a positive first impression and enhance the brand. It will also help
generate more business and increase sales.

The target audience is individuals looking for a reliable local garage to get their cars
repaired or advice on parts, cars and motorbikes.

* User 1 has an issue with their car they’ll be able to check if this
garage is potentially able to fix it by reading about the services offered on the front
page. They can check the location and opening times on the contact page and see if
they suit them. They can also ask for a quote by filling in the form on the contact
page.

* User 2 is looking for used cars or motorbike from a trustworthy source, and
comes across this website where he can find available models and send a
query about them through the website.

* User 3 is in an emergency and needs their car fixed by Monday to be able to go to
work. He is looking for a mechanic who’s working flexible hours, even weekends.
Looking at the contact page he can check the opening hours and quickly contact the
business by calling the telephone number in red on the top of the page.

Users see the same layout and overall colour scheme on all 4 pages. 

The website is responsive, on small and medium viewports the menu bar turns into a button and also the content adjusts to smaller than large screen sizes.

See the link below to the wireframe of the project outlining the visuals and features of
the website.
